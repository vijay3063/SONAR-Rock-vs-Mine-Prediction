# Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification

This project uses the **Sonar dataset** to build a machine learning model that can distinguish between **rocks (R)** and **mines (M)** based on sonar signal returns.  
The dataset contains 60 numeric features (signal strengths at different frequencies), and the target column indicates whether the object is a rock or a mine.

Started journey, and projects on Machine Learning.
